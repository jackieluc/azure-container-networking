Use all `agents.md` files found from the repository root to the current directory as instructions and context, applying them in root-to-leaf order; if instructions conflict, the `agents.md` closest to the current directory takes precedence. Use relevant repo skills from `.github/skills/` when applicable.

Public authorship is human-owned. Copilot and all other AI agents must never
comment, reply, review, react, resolve threads, or edit/close/reopen public
PR/issue text or metadata. Draft text for a human maintainer instead. Read-only
GitHub access remains allowed. Branch pushes are allowed. PR creation and
workflow/release actions are allowed only when the current user task explicitly
requests that action.

# Copilot Instructions for Azure Container Networking

## Available Skills

For task-specific guidance, use the appropriate skill:

| Skill | When to use |
|-------|-------------|
| `acn-go-version-bump` | Go version upgrades, FIPS/systemcrypto config, Dockerfile template updates, CVE patches |
| `acn-go-errors-logging` | Error string formatting, zap logging discipline |
| `acn-go-context-lifecycle` | Context propagation and lifecycle management |
| `acn-go-design-boundaries` | Package boundaries and design patterns |
| `acn-go-interfaces-dependencies` | Interface design and dependency injection |
| `acn-go-types-parsing` | Type definitions and parsing logic |
| `acn-go-http-api-contracts` | HTTP API contracts and handlers |
| `acn-go-platform-abstraction` | Platform-specific abstractions |
| `acn-go-control-plane-contracts` | Control plane contracts |

## General Guidelines

- This repository builds container networking components for Azure (CNI, CNS, NPM, etc.)
- Build system uses `make dockerfiles` with template rendering via `renderkit`
- Tools dependencies are managed via a dedicated modfile (`tools.go.mod` at repo root, or `tools-go/go.mod` in some branches)
- CI uses both GitHub Actions and Azure Pipelines (`.pipelines/`)
- `cilium-log-collector` is the only component using `CGO_ENABLED=1`
- All other components use `CGO_ENABLED=0`
- **GOEXPERIMENT requirements are version-dependent** — consult the `acn-go-version-bump` skill for current rules. As of Go 1.26: CGO=1 needs `systemcrypto`, CGO=0 needs `ms_nocgo_opensslcrypto`. Go 1.27+ changes these rules.
